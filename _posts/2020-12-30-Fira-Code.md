*This tutorial is beginner friendly so if you already know about `fira code` you might want to skip this part and move to [Using Fira Code and Ligatures](#css).*

For those who are not familiar with fira code, it is one of the most popular fonts for coding, and the reason for that is - not only it's an artistic font, it also provides `Ligatures` which are symbols for common programming multi-character combinations.

Let's take a look at some examples

Character Combination: **->**

Ligature:
```python
->
```
Character Combination: **!=**

Ligature:
```python
!=
```
Character Combination: **==**

Ligature:
```python
==
```
There's no reason to discuss all the details about the font, head to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fira_(typeface)) for more information or go to the [FiraCode GitHub link](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) if you want to use fira code anywhere else and for other examples of ligatures and use cases.

## Using Fira Code and Ligatures {#css}
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&display=swap');

.input_area pre, .input_area div, code {
  font-family: 'Fira Code' !important;
  font-variant-ligatures: initial !important;
}
```
Add these lines in `/_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss` at root of your repository and you are good to go.

{% include info.html text="<strong>Fira Code font is only used in code cells of both notebook and markdown</strong>" %}

{% include alert.html text="<strong>Clear browser cache and wait for github actions to finish executing if the effects do not appear immediately</strong>" %}

Use this [link](https://github.com/ashudva/KED/blob/master/_sass/minima/font-style.scss) to get my other font-styles and if you decide to create a new `font-style.scss` file as in my case, do not forget to add `@import "minima/font-style";` in `custom-styles.scss`
